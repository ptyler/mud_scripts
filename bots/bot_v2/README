What the fuck is new... 

New concept, beta is over. 

New bot is based on improved thinking, thanks to conversations we've had about inputs vs.
outputs; queues etc.

This version will try to keep track of what's happening, by using mud output
as input; in order to determine the outcome of it's input to the mud... 

MAKES SENSE TO ME, even though it may not read that way... 


First, organization... shit has been broken up/organized 

I've been collecting triggers to act on, in order to better "see" what 
the char is doing vs. what bot has asked the char to do.


File structure:

act<Filename>.tt ::

	- These files contain actions we'll use to get feedback from the mud
	I've tried to keep these organized, where the filename does a
	descent job of identifying what sort of actions are in what files.

	- These files will also contain functions/alias related to the processing of actions in the same category.


bot<Filename>.tt ::

	- These files will be related to the bot logic and state information.. they are the "Bot"
	- These files don't have any "command" specific shit in them... or shouldn't, anyway.


do<Filename>.tt ::

	- These files are command specific, they handle the interfacing with  the mud, such as 
	getting targets (doCombat) and walking, etc.

chk<Filename>.tt ::  

	- There will likely only be one of these (chkStates.tt), but it (they) will handle state checking, etc.

File List:

--------------------------


Actions ::


actCombat.tt: 

	- Contains combat related actions (R.I.P, fight pulse on hits, etc.)


actInform.tt

	- Contains actions that will deal out general information to the bot (room changes, time of day, etc.)

actMisc.tt

	- Contains general/misc actions

actStates.tt

	- Contains all actions/functions related to setting/unsetting states (iswalk, isrest, issleep, ismount etc.)


Bot ::


botBrain.tt

	- Contains the main bot logic... get a command from the queue, check if I can do
	it, execute and wait for feedback from the mud... repeat.


botConfig.tt

	- Contains variables/alias/functions related to configuration of the bot... ie. setting modes, 
	setting equipment/food/drink as well as variables that can/should be tweaked. 

	- this has a save function, so the user can save config info to load next time... thx #class


botStates.tt

	- Contains all variables used to store/check states (isrest, issleep, etc.)




Commands ::


doStack.tt

	- This contains the preliminary logic for setting up the queue, and executing
	commands from it, by popping them off etc. 

	- Also contains logic to insert/add to the list

	- List itself consists of two indexes, one for main commands (walk/fight/etc.) and one for a combat queue 
	(kick/bash/whatever)


doMove.tt

	- This will contain the logic to walk... pretty easy

doCombat.tt

	- This will contian the logic to fight/setup a hitlist/sort through hitlists, etc.







Zones directory ::

This dir will hold all zone info, maps, mob triggers, zone specific shit.
