Quick and dirty:

- Setup the botBrain.tt to do some simple checking/walking/confirming/repeat

- Add doCombat to work with the queue, using actions for fight feedback and
list building

- Add more complete logic for resting, once the above are done



- Move on to more advanced/detailed stuff

	- Map navigation
	- Detailed combat logic, dealing with assister/assistee etc.
	- Dealing with coins/items
	- Equiment
	- Recalling/fleeing in combat danger situations
	- Detecting players/assassination attempts
	- Notifications on user interaction required (tells etc.)
	- Lots and lots... no limits really
