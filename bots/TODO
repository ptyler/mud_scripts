doEatDrink.class:
-----------------

-- TODO:
--------



-- IDEAS:
---------

- Can add logic for out of food, out of drink

	- Stop the bot? ring bells? scream for human intervention?

- Better logic for containers




---------------
doCombat.class:
---------------

-- TODO:
--------


- Add checks for mob types
	- calculating HP reqs to attack an assistee, with it's assistant in the room, else don't attack assitee


-- IDEAS:
---------

- Possibly interegrate "scan" to see what is going to be in the next room, and avoid "agressive" mobs 
	- or at least count how many there are to determine if you can fuck them all up or not before you wander in

- Build lists of mobs with arrays, that can be saved to an output file, for later reading back in

	- replace action triggers with these types of lists

- Have varying combat modes

	- Cautious: Avoid agressive/assistants
	- Normal: Kill based on HP min, and avoid assistants
	- Hitman: Target specific mobs only (coin/item runs, with this type)
