* TODO Shit... stuff to actually do, ideas below TODO list *
************************************************************




-------------
General shit:
-------------

-- TODO:
--------

- Put all this shit together to get a bot that is actually working at the
  basic level, based on what is  already coded.

- Cleanup logic

- Cleanup unused vars and actions

- Find stupid fuckin spaces that are outputting carrige returns every 
  pulse... think doEatDrink.class is the culprit


-- IDEAS:
---------

- Lots and lots... 




-----------
ccs.bot.tt:
-----------

-- TODO:
--------

- Figure out the best way to generalize this so that other shit can be loaded
  for regular play scripts, etc.

- Pull out all actions/vars/triggers that could go in individual *.class scripts



-- IDEAS:
---------





--------------
doPulse.class:
--------------

-- TODO:
--------

- Clean up unused shit

- Clean up code itself to eliminate any extra shit being sent to the mud
 


-- IDEAS:
---------






-------------
doMove.class:
-------------

-- TODO:
--------

- Associate doCombat in here... so that the violence pulse is based on the
  walk pulse, ( ie. walk first, check health, then check room for a fight? )

- Add logic for various states, resting, sitting etc.

- Determine best way to setup state variables, (rest, sit, sleep, etc.)


-- IDEAS:
---------


- Lots more can be added here, based on ideas one might have for stuff

- Map integration for pathing instead of static routes from "#path walk"





-----------------
doEatDrink.class:
-----------------

-- TODO:
--------

- Think this is pretty much roughed out for now

- Clean up unused shit

- Find what is sending unused output to the mud, double/triple prompt bug (thats my name for it)



-- IDEAS:
---------

- Can add logic for out of food, out of drink

	- Stop the bot? ring bells? scream for human intervention?

- Better logic for containers




---------------
doCombat.class:
---------------

-- TODO:
--------

- FUCK... this needs cleaned, and made operational at a very basic level

	- Scan room, build a list of mobs,HP
	- Pick a mob, kill it.
	- Integrate into main bot so that we have a working version


-- IDEAS:
---------

- Figure out mob types (Normal, Assistee, Agressive, Assistant)

	- Can use these types to determine course of action in a room

		- Don't attack based on Assistant being in same room as assistee
		- If it's a normal mob, just kill it
		- If there is assister/assistee in the same room, but you  are currently a badass with enough HP to kill both... then do it
		- Possibly interegrate "scan" to see what is going to be in the next room, and avoid "agressive" mobs 
			- or at least count how many there are to determine if you can fuck them all up or not before you wander in
		- Etc.

- Build lists of mobs with arrays, that can be saved to an output file, for later reading back in

	- replace action triggers with these types of lists

- Have varying combat modes

	- Cautious: Avoid agressive/assistants
	- Killer: Fuck em all, you can clear this zone
	- Normal: Kill based on HP min, and avoid assistants
	- Hitman: Target specific mobs only (coin/item runs, with this type)
